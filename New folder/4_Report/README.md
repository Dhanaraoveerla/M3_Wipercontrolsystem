# Wiper Control System
## Introduction
The concept of network of smart devices, otherwise whenmore things/objects connected to internet to sense thedevices and interchange the sensed data using WirelessSensor Networks (WSN), using corrective and detectiveprotocols is termed as Internet of Things [1]. Cloud com-puting is one of the system resources specially designed tostore data with very less management by the user. Com-bination of IoT and cloud technology work towards toimprove the efﬁciency, security, managing and accessingof data. Cloud computing makes IoT more secure protocolwith preventive authentication and encryption protocols.Using cloud computing user can easily add the objects tothe internet with less hardware and software [2]. Cloudtechnology has three different types of platforms likeSoftware as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as shown in Fig. 1.These services can be accessed in public, private or hybridtype of cloud. CloudIoT gives ﬂexibility, scalability, pri-vacy and efﬁcient use of resources to the user. CloudIoTtechnology acts like a gateway between the real world anddigital world. In this work, CloudIoT application using(PaaS) is developed for automated windshield wipercontrolsystem.
## Research
-   In todays automobile environment high end cars and cer-tain heavy goods transport vehicles are ﬁtted with expen-sive automatic windshield wipers where the maintenanceand troubleshooting posed major problems. In [5] devel-oped a system called Advanced Driver Assistance system(ADAS) using real time drop detection using CellularNeural Networks (CNN) and support vector machines(SVM) which assists the drivers snow, rainy and mistconditions to control the wiper speed. Article [6] presenteda wiper system based on Electrochemical rain sensor.
## Components Required
### Ardiuno
-   The Arduino hardware and software was designed for artists, designers, hobbyists, hackers, newbies, and anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments. Arduino can interact with buttons, LEDs, motors, speakers, GPS units, cameras, the internet!(![61HWKZzJoyL _AC_SX679_](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101260690/168412996-289decf8-1297-4254-b6eb-1e8daa3bbec5.jpg)
### Temperature Sensor
-   The measurement of the temperature sensor is about the coolness or hotness of an entity. The working of the sensor is the voltage that is read across the diode. If there is an increment in voltage, then the temperature increases and there is a voltage decrement between the transistor terminals of the emitter and the base. That data is saved by the sensor.
-   If the difference in voltage is amplified, then an analog signal is generated by the device, and it is directly proportional to the temperature.
### Thermostat
-   A thermostat is a regulating device component which senses the temperature of a physical system and performs actions so that the system's temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint.
-   A thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. A thermostat can often be the main control unit for a heating or cooling system, in applications ranging from ambient air control to automotive coolant control. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature.
### Heater core
-   A heater core is a radiator-like device used to heat a vehicle's cabin. Hot coolant from the vehicle's engine is routed through the core's winding tube, which acts as a heat exchanger between the coolant and the cabin air. Fins attached to the core tubes increase the surface area for heat transfer to air forced past them by a fan, thus heating the passenger compartment.
### LCD (liquid crystal display)
-   Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is an electronic device, which is frequently used in many applications for displaying the information in a text or image format.
### LED (Light-emitting diode)
-   The lighting emitting diode is a p-n junction diode. It is a specially doped diode and made up of a special type of semiconductors. When the light emits in the forward biased, then it is called a light-emitting diode.

### What
In the rain, wiper control can make cars much more comfortable. wiper system that raises the surface temperature of the automated wiper to the comfort of the occupants.
### Where
-   In the rain, a wiper control is extremely useful. If you are an early riser, you may find the early morning commute to work unbelievably cold and uncomfortable, especially if you have to drive in rainy season it cleans the mirror.
### When
-   All humid car mirror covers have some form of wiper-control mechanism to allow car users to set a high or low-temperature setting, and when there’s no need to heat up the seats, the wiper can be turned off.
### Why
-   It is ideal for older drivers or those who live in cold climates because it heats the wiper and makes it more comfortable for both the driver and the passenger.
### How
-   While wipers are no longer considered a luxury item, many vehicles still come standard with non-humid mirrors.
-   People who want to convert their regular car wipers into wiper control can do so by using clean car mirror.

## Conclusion
-   As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system
was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the
design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this field. For the future improvement, it is
recommended the system to have literature review on the material been used as the wiper, because the material used is
still has a problem in the procure issues especially for the hot and climate country. Other suggestion for designing
automatic push up wiper for future research and improvement is about the design stand for the wiper
