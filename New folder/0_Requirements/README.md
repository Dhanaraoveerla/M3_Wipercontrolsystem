## Introduction
The concept of network of smart devices, otherwise when
more things/objects connected to internet to sense the
devices and interchange the sensed data using Wireless
Sensor Networks (WSN), using corrective and detective
protocols is termed as Internet of Things [1]. Cloud computing is one of the system resources specially designed to
store data with very less management by the user. Combination of IoT and cloud technology work towards to
improve the efficiency, security, managing and accessing
of data. Cloud computing makes IoT more secure protocol
with preventive authentication and encryption protocols.
Using cloud computing user can easily add the objects to
the internet with less hardware and software [2]. Cloud
technology has three different types of platforms like
Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS)
and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) as shown in Fig. 1.
These services can be accessed in public, private or hybrid
type of cloud. CloudIoT gives flexibility, scalability, privacy and efficient use of resources to the user. CloudIoT
technology acts like a gateway between the real world and
digital world. In this work, CloudIoT application using
(PaaS) is developed for automated windshield wiper control system.
## Research
-   In todays automobile environment high end cars and certain heavy goods transport vehicles are fitted with expensive automatic windshield wipers where the maintenance
and troubleshooting posed major problems. In [5] developed a system called Advanced Driver Assistance system
(ADAS) using real time drop detection using Cellular
Neural Networks (CNN) and support vector machines
(SVM) which assists the drivers snow, rainy and mist
conditions to control the wiper speed. Article [6] presented
a wiper system based on Electrochemical rain sensor
## Components Required
An automated smart wiper control system using IoT and
cloud computing has been designed in the proposed system
which consists of CC3200-XL launchpad, YL-63 rain
sensor, Hardware embedded system, GSM SIM900A.

### What
In the rain season, wiper controlsytem can make cars much more comfortable. clean that raises the surface moisture of the automated wiper to the comfort of the drives.
### Where
-   In the rain season, a wiper control system is extremely useful. If you are an early riser, you may find the early morning commute to work unbelievably cold and uncomfortable.
### When
-   All wiper control system covers have some form of moisture-control mechanism to allow car users to set a high or low-moisture setting, and when thereâ€™s no need to clean up the mirrors, the moisture can be turned off.
### Why
-   It is ideal for older drivers or those who live in rain climates because it heats the seat and makes it more comfortable for both the driver and the passenger.
### How
-   While control system are no longer considered a luxury item, many vehicles still come standard with accidents.
-   People who want to convert their regular control system into clean can do so by using control system covers.
